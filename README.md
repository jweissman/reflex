# Synopsis

A general-purpose, reflection-oriented language for the contemporary web.

# About

A reflecting language, inspired by Ruby, Eiffel, Self, Smalltalk.
This repo contains the grammar, the vm and the cli harness.
Implemented in Typescript.

# Getting Started

Still a bit too early for hello world, but [the specs](src/reflex/Reflex.spec.ts) have lots of Reflex code examples.
A [fledgling language reference](LANGUAGE.md) is also available.

# Status
`reflex` is still highly experimental! Lots of things are still in progress.

The `reflex` command line tool should act both as a runner and an interpreter shell (repl).
(Without args, it is a repl; give it a file and it will interpret as Reflex.)

# Roadmap
"grind and polish" cycles. let's just do two for now.

0.1 (grind) -- core object model. core types (bool, number, array, string, dict, tuple). mirrors and bindings. xml lit.

0.2 (polish) -- refactor, document, cleanup -- optimization, bugfixes

0.3 (grind) -- stdlib (files, network, math). modules/packages. traits, archetypes.

0.4 (polish) -- refactor, document, cleanup -- optimization, bugfixes
